# Assessment-4

## Getting Started
The task for GEOL0069: AI for Earth Observation 25/26 (Week 4) is to classify Sentinel-3 radar altimetry waveforms over Arctic sea ice using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). This unsupervised machine learning method clusters waveforms into sea ice or leads based on their reflection patterns. Results are validated against ground truth data from the European Space Agency (ESA) to quantify classification accuracy via a confusion matrix.
